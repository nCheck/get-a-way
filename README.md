get-a-way
Team Name: NAPSACK

Problem Statement: A common problem faced by tourists nowadays is lack of perfect itenary. How to utilize their stay fully is the biggest question. Also sometimes it happens the place they plan to visit turns out to be closed , under-maintenance or overcrowded due its peak hour

Solution: Solution to above problems is our get-a-way App. This app will take into account duration of stay , and locations. Based on this input with the help of Google Places realtime API, we will be able to provide best possible travel plan, must visit places suggestions and best time to visit to avoid the above mentioned problems. User will also be able to add the place they definitely wants to visit and the tour plan will try to route the plan accordingly. We will try to keep this app hybrid so that it will target all major devices.
